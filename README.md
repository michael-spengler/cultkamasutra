# Cult Kamasutra
This is an education project to spread [love](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo/), [fairness](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/blob/main/README.md) and fun by supporting the [cult](https://cultdao.io/manifesto.pdf).

After we had been f.cked as working class slaves for several years, we decided to f.ck the former f.ckers (only financially of course). This is why we from https://sportkamasutra.com chose to support the [cult](https://cultdao.io) by providing a [cultic version](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) and some other [fancy shit](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo).

We also join the [cult](https://cultdao.io) to end [manipulation](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) and to foster the emergence of reasonable and [fair](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/blob/main/README.md) systems based on the [distributed-ledger-technology](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture), based on a healthy common sense, based on respect for the respectful and based on you as you are reading this.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome - e.g. via Pull Requests.

### Cult Kamasutra NFTs 
One idea to further support the [cult](https://cultdao.io/manifesto.pdf) might be to offer [cultkamasutra](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) NFTs, which can be invested in by using [cult](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cult-dao/).  

### Cult Kamasutra Community Chat
Another idea to further support the [cult](https://cultdao.io/manifesto.pdf) might be to offer chatrooms and videorooms via decentralized infrastructures, so that [cultkamasutra](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) fans can come together, share experiences etc. 

## CULT.DAO Proposals
We consider to [submit a combined proposal](https://app.cultdao.io/submitProposal) to ask the [cultdao](https://cultdao.io) voters if they like our ideas for further features, which are also listed [here](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/blob/main/README.md) and which would need to be detailed out.    
We also consider providing a workflow based on the [contributor assistant](https://github.com/contributor-assistant) to simplify the provisioning of the required parameters - which are:   
1. Name of the Guardian submitting the Proposal   
2. Guardian Discord or Twitter Handle   
3. Guardian Wallet Address   
4. What is the name of the Project?  
5. Provide a short description of the Project, and why it is suitable for investment from the CULT  
6. Please provide either an investment deck, a Litepaper or a whitepaper. This must include your tokenomics, will all current token owners, your projected future fund raise and all details    
7. Provide all social channels associated with the project  
8. Provide links to the audited token and contracts  
9. Provide the percentage of the token supply being offered in return for 13 Ethereum worth of investment (0.25 - 5)  
10. Provide the rate at which the investee token will be swapped for CULT. For example X% per day, week or month, for x number of months  
11. Confirm 50% of the CULT once swapped will be sent to our dCULT contract and 50% sent to a burn wallet  
12. Confirm that the anticipated IDO date is within 12 weeks of the end date of the proposal  
13. Provide the main ethereum wallet for the project
