# Cult Kamasutra
This is an education project to spread [love](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo/), [fairness](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/blob/main/README.md) and fun by supporting the [cult](https://cultdao.io/manifesto.pdf).

After we had been f.cked as working class slaves for several years, we decided to f.ck the former f.ckers (only financially of course). This is why we from https://sportkamasutra.com chose to support the [cult](https://cultdao.io) by providing a [cultic version](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) and some other [fancy shit](https://cultdao-ecosystem.eth.limo).

We join the cult to end [manipulation](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/real-life-thrillers.md) and to foster the emergence of reasonable and [fair](https://github.com/michael-spengler/fairness/blob/main/README.md) systems.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome - e.g. via Pull Requests.

### Cult Kamasutra NFTs 
One idea to further support the [cult](https://cultdao.io/manifesto.pdf) might be to offer [cultkamasutra](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) NFTs, which can be invested in by using [cult](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cult-dao/).  

### Cult Kamasutra Community Chat
Another idea to further support the [cult](https://cultdao.io/manifesto.pdf) might be to offer chatrooms and videorooms via decentralized infrastructures, so that [cultkamasutra](https://cultkamasutra.eth.limo) fans can come together, share experiences etc.
